# Marble Simulator

Simple browser-based experiments for simulating marble movement and physics-inspired interactions. The project currently includes multiple HTML prototypes (`marble_roll.html`, `marble_sim_1.html`) that can be opened directly in a browser.

## Getting Started

1. Open any of the HTML files in your preferred browser.
2. Interact with the page to explore the current simulation prototype.

## Project Structure

- `marble_roll.html` – Prototype focused on basic marble rolling behavior.
- `marble_sim_1.html` – Alternate simulation experiment with different parameters.
- `x_sinx.R` – Supporting R script, likely for data exploration or plotting.

## Contributing

Feel free to branch off `main` for new experiments. Keep HTML prototypes self-contained so they can run without a build step.
